Planar 2-links robot simulator: report

\begin_layout Part*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This package has the purpose of simulating a planar robot with two links.
 The links are ideal (uni-dimensional) and the actuator is modelled as a
 material point.
 Degree of freedom of the simulation are the lengths of the links, the maximum
 linear speed of the robot, the simulation step, the way the state of the
 simulation is to be plotted (or not) during the simulation itself, and,
 very importantly, the way the signal is to be provided to the simulator.
 There are three ways to do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mode 1: the signal is already stored in some variables, in a row array format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mode 2: an arbitrary number of continuous signals can be plotted by the
 user by cursor; they will be stored and then simulated later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mode 3: an arbitrary number of continuous signals can be plotted by the
 user by cursor, so that the simulated robot will follow them in real time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package offers two user interface functions, 
\family typewriter
prepare_simulation
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
start_simulation
\family default
.
 The former takes the parameter listed above (and, in case, other user inputs)
 as inputs, and returns a custom structure, which contains the parameters
 needed for the real simulation and is then to be given as input to 
\family typewriter
start_simulation
\family default
, which will effectively run the simulation.
 This call returns the significant signals of the simulation in a column
 vector format.
 Details on these functions are to be found in Part I.
 Other functions, used internally by these two, are specified in Part II.
 Finally, the Simulink model and the MATLAB interpreted functions used in
 it are described in Part III.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Control method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with any manipulator, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\dot{x}=J\dot{q}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the position of the actuator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=(q1,q2)$
\end_inset

 is the vector of generalized coordinates and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J}$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian of the system.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x^{*}}(t)$
\end_inset

 as the reference signal (the trajectory we want our robot to follow), which
 we require to be differentiable (and, therefore, continuous); observe that,
 since we work on a discrete (computer) system, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

differentiable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will mean that the difference quotient, computed with a step 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{step}$
\end_inset

, exists and is less, in absolute value, than an arbitrary maximum value
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}$
\end_inset

 (both 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{step}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}$
\end_inset

 will be passed to 
\family typewriter
prepare_sim
\family default
 by the user as input parameters).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t)\coloneqq\mathbf{x}(t)-\mathbf{x}^{*}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Now, if J is invertible and well conditioned, i.e.
 we are sufficiently far from the singularity points, we can impose the
 following input signal,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{\dot{q}}=\mathbf{J}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}^{*}(t)-\mathbf{K\boldsymbol{\delta}x}(t))
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{K}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix with positive eigenvalues.
 We obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{\delta}\dot{\mathbf{\mathbf{x}}}(t)=\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)-\mathbf{\dot{x}}^{*}(t)=\mathbf{J\dot{q}}-\mathbf{\dot{x}}^{*}(t)=-\mathbf{K}\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}=e^{-\mathbf{K}t}\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t_{0})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the starting time of simulation.
 So, in general we'll have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{0}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
while, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t_{0})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $t\ge t_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 In the program, we will always aim to have null initial error, in order
 to have null error in the whole simulation (except for numerical errors);
 for this reason, we'll have to know the initial value of the signal and
 position the robot in the corresponding configuration before the start
 of the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decisions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the development of the package, a few decisions had to be taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Under what abnormal circumstances does the simulation stop with error? At
 first, it was decided for this to happen when the reference point is unreachabl
e and when the reference signal's speed exceeds the maximum one of the robot.
 In the end, this is what was done for the 
\family typewriter
OFFLINE
\family default
 modes.
 In the 
\family typewriter
ONLINE
\family default
 mode, it is hard for the user to properly control the speed of the cursor
 as the plot is drawn in real-time; so, if the maximum speed is exceeded,
 the robot moves at its maximum speed possible, i.e.
 it tries to keep up with the user.
 Hopefully, the user will slow down to adapt to the robot's maximum pace.
 Of course, even in 
\family typewriter
ONLINE
\family default
 mode, an unreachable point causes the simulation to stop with error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the 
\family typewriter
ONLINE
\family default
 mode, the reference signal is not known before the beginning of the simulation;
 however, in order to have null error for each time instant (at least theoretica
lly), the robot is supposed to start at the initial conditions that correspond
 to the signal.
 To see how this can be handled, suppose that the robot is initially in
 an arbitrary configuration.
 When the user starts drawing the signal, in general a jump will happen
 (from the arbitrary initial point to the first drawn point); this is not
 realistic, as it would imply a very high (theoritically infinite) speed
 of the links.
 However, suppose there was a mechanism that, when the user starts drawing,
 computes a valid trajectory for the robot to reach the new point.
 In this simulator, it was decided to suppose that such a mechanism exists,
 and to consider as valid only the results of the simulations after the
 initial conditions have been reached.
 For details on how this is implemented, consult the Simulink model documentatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The simulator can be further developed, for example by creating a complete
 user interface, detailing the actuator's state (by attaching a frame of
 reference to it), associating a SimScape model to the Simulink scheme and
 many other things.
 Because of time constraints, it was decided to omit these features for
 now.

 However, to make the code more compact, it was decided to use a 
\family typewriter
FOR
\family default
 loop with an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 number of loops (and the 
\family typewriter
BREAK
\family default
 condition stated above).
 However, such a loop raises the warning 
\family typewriter
Warning: Too many FOR loop iterations.
 Stopping after 9223372036854775806 iterations.
\family default
; since infinite loops are undoable anyway, it was then opted to use, as
 number of loops, the number indicated in the warning (9223372036854775806).
 However, the warning was still issued.
 The number used in the end was 922337203685477572 (which should be enough
 for all cases).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A local variable, 
\family typewriter
no_more_simulations_needed
\family default
, is initialized to 0; the loop on the simulations has a 
\family typewriter
BREAK
\family default
 condition on 
\family typewriter
no_more_simulations_needed
\family default
 becoming 1.
 This change of value happens when the user refuses to run a new simulation,
 choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the message box displayed by the MATLAB interpreted function 
\family typewriter
read_cursor_input
\family default
.
 When that happens, the instruction 
\family typewriter
assignin('caller', 'no_more_simulations_needed', 1);
\family default
 (executed in 
\family typewriter
read_cursor_input
\family default
) injects the value 1 into 
\family typewriter
no_more_simulations_needed
\family default
.
 Note that the use of function 
\family typewriter
assignin
\family default
 is discouraged as it is slow and hides data dependencies; however, as a
 special case it was choosen to use it for his compactness and the fact
 that it is executed at most once in the run of 
\family typewriter
starting_simulation
\family default
.

 after the plot is completed, it could not be used in the

 However, it was decided to use it here, and not to use the custom routine

Simulink model documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After an introduction, each of the following sections is associated to an
 area of the Simulink model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model uses a set of variables; each one is associated to a GOTO block.
 In particular, 
\family typewriter
l1
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
l2
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
sw
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
vmax
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
tmin
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
plot_mode
\family default
 are used in all modes with obvious role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variable 
\family typewriter
starting_time
\family default
 is computed at every step in the Achievement of initial position area,
 and holds value 
\family typewriter
tmin
\family default
 in 
\family typewriter
OFFLINE
\family default
 modes; in 
\family typewriter
ONLINE
\family default
 mode, it has value -1 before the initial conditions are reached, and their
 time of achievement afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variable 
\family typewriter
reset
\family default
 is computed at every step in the Reference signal acquisition area, and
 is always valued 0 in 
\family typewriter
OFFLINE
\family default
 modes.
 In 
\family typewriter
ONLINE
\family default
 mode, it is valued 0 before the user has started drawing, and 1 afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variable 
\family typewriter
ended
\family default
 is computed at every step in the Reference signal acquisition area, and
 is valued 0 before the simulation has ended, 1 afterwards.
 Since the non-abnormal end of the simulation is issued as an input of 1
 to the 
\family typewriter
STOP
\family default
 block, this parameter can be used by the other areas in the remaining execution
 of the last step of simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORTANT: the Simulink model is run from the 
\family typewriter
start_simulation
\family default
 function (through a call to the 
\family typewriter
sim
\family default
 function), and the simulation parameters, including the simulation step,
 are given as parameters there.
 HOWEVER, don't put different settings in the Simulink configuration parameters
 settings.
 For example, calling 
\family typewriter
sim
\family default
 with a fixed step parameter AND setting the solver to 
\family typewriter
auto
\family default
 in the solver configuration parameters settings will cause Simulink to
 set as actual simulation step the GCD of the 
\family typewriter
sim
\family default
 parameter and a Simulink-generated step.
 This WILL cause confusion, so be careful.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Note
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At implementation time, a convenient way to capture the position of the
 cursor at each instant was seeked.
 Consider the command 
\family typewriter
get(gca, 'CurrentPoint');
\family default
; it returns the cursor's coordinates with respect to the current axes,
 but only returns the last clicked or unclicked point, ignoring the points
 over which the cursor hovered.
 Oddly enough, the command 
\family typewriter
get(0, 'PointerLocation');
\family default
 returns the points with respect to the screen coordinates, but at all times,
 not only when the user clicks or unclicks.
 The second instruction is therefore used; however, the obtained point must
 be converted to the figure/axes coordinates, and this is the reason for
 which the values computed by 
\family typewriter
compute_screen_parameters
\family default
 are provided as input to 
\family typewriter
read_cursor_input
\family default
.
 The formulas to convert the points were obtained through a simple transformatio
n of coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, consider the x coordinate.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $L\coloneqq l_{1}+l_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{L}\coloneqq$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
dist_left
\family default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{R}\coloneqq$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
dist_right
\family default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $w\coloneqq$
\end_inset


\family typewriter
screen_width
\family default
.
 To transform the value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{s}$
\end_inset

 (relative to screen coordinates) to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

 (relative to axes coordinates), we need the straight line going through
 the points (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{s}=d_{L}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}=-2L$
\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{s}=w-d_{R}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}=2L$
\end_inset

), that is, the straight line satisfying the equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $-2L=m_{x}d_{L}+q_{x}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $2L=m_{x}(w-d_{R})+q_{x}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{x}$
\end_inset

 easily gives 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{x}=\frac{4L}{w-d_{R}-d_{L}},q_{x}=-2L-\frac{4L}{w-d_{R}-d_{L}}d_{L}$
\end_inset

, which are the relationships used in the program (rearranged in order to
 avoid multiple computations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{4L}{w-d_{R}-d_{L}}$
\end_inset

).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For now, ignore the delay block.
 Before 
\family typewriter
RESET
\family default
 is set to a positive value, i.e.
 before the user has started drawing, a null derivative is provided (any
 finite signal would do, as this part is going to be ignored).
 Roughly after 
\family typewriter
RESET
\family default
 changes sign, a saturated version of the derivative of the hand(cursor)-drawn
 reference signal is provided instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The saturation allows the simulation not to crash on the user when the latter
 exceeds the maximum speed of the robot (however, the robot will proceed
 at its maximum velocity, forcing the user to slow down).
 Finally, the delay block is necessary because, when the user starts drawing,
 a jump will happen, i.e.
 the derivative of the cursor-drawn signal will be very high.
 We want the robot to start as still, so we provide null derivative for
 a few more time steps.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Note 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function, when plotting is enabled, is the bottleneck of the whole
 simulator, and dominates the execution time.
 For example, with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{min}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{max}=6$
\end_inset

 s, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{step}=0.001$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{*}(t)=(0.7\mathrm{cos}(10t),0.7\mathrm{sin}(10t)+0.01)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{max}=100$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}=0.8$
\end_inset

, the simulation takes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
10.931683 seconds with 
\family typewriter
plot_mode = PLOT_WITH_LINKS
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
10.247887 seconds with 
\family typewriter
plot_mode = PLOT_NO_LINKS
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1.670445 seconds with 
\family typewriter
plot_mode = NO_PLOT
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although qualitatively, these results show the fact that the plotting heavily
 affects the running time.
 To avoid even more overhead, in the case of 
\family typewriter
plot_mode = PLOT_WITH_LINKS
\family default
 the two links are plotted through a single instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Note 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function uses a local persistent variable, 
\family typewriter
plotted
\family default
, to store the latest element plotted in the figure in 
\family typewriter
PLOT_WITH_LINKS
\family default
 plot mode.
 At each call, if the variable is not empty, i.e.
 after the first links configuration is plotted, the command 
\family typewriter
delete(plotted)
\family default
 is issued, in order to erase the previous links configuration plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\family typewriter
start_simulation
\family default
, after each simulation, the functions that use persistent variables are
 cleared (i.e.
 their persistent variables are reset to empty values), except for this
 one.
 This is because, after the end of a simulation, if there is a next one
 plotted will contain the latest links configuration of the previous simulation,
 and will be automatically erased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the command 
\family typewriter
clear plot_robot_position
\family default
 must be issued before 
\family typewriter
start_simulation
\family default
 returns (and, in case of error exit, in 
\family typewriter
exit_with_error
\family default
, too).
